autofill needs work
- shadow roots fuck it up
- somehow the messaging bs dosent work
- adding a button is hella annoying

autologin gen
- settings are a toggle anda input for a custom domain
- idea is that it generated a (opt derived) login@customdomain.tld for the login instead of using the default one.

compat stuff
- on install open settings
- on update open settings
